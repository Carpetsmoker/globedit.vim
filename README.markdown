Add variants of `:edit` and friends that can take a globbing pattern to open
multiple files:

    :Edit plugin/*.vim doc/*.doc
    :Split ??_*.c

See `:help wildcards` for a overview of the globbing patterns interpreted by Vim.

Compare this to the default behaviour of `:edit *.vim`, which will either:

- open a file named `*.vim` if there are no matches;
- open the file if there is exactly one match;
- error out with `E77: Too many file names ` if there are more than one
  matches.
